Early warning system for detecting garbage chute clogs based on ESP32-S3.

The `docs/spec_v1.3.md` file contains the current technical specification (in Russian).

This repository now includes a skeleton PlatformIO project targeting **ESP32-S3 DevKitC-1**. The code provides basic Wi-Fi, MQTT and web server setup along with a simple LED state machine.
